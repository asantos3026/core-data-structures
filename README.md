# Core Data Structures

Tests and implementations for common data structures. See the full list in the [data-structures.md](data-structures.md) file.

Base repository for the [Core Data Structures](http://jsdev.learnersguild.org/goals/128) goal.

## Installation and Setup

- Clone the repo
```git clone https://github.com/asantos3026/core-data-structures```

- Install all Node packages and dependencies
```npm install```

You can run the tests on each data structure by using this command in the terminal

npm run test

Or you can run the data structures in the terminal using 

node src/<data_structure>
